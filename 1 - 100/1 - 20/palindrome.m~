% Problem 4: A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
% The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
% Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

            % This part establishes the palindromes. 
            % The "all" portion of the above condition checks if all
            % elements of the string are the same as their mirrored
            % representation (if they are, then that means the number is a palindrome). 
            % Lastly, the "end" in the string means starting at the last character in
            % the string, for however many characters are present.
